My game is Two Player Jeopardy that has a theme based on fiction books.
There are four fiction books in this game and each book is a round.
I focused on creating a simple and accessible version of this game that allows players to type their answers when they pressed buttons on the screen.

# technologiesused
I used javascript, html, and css to create this version of jeopardy.

#challenges
I had challenges with bugs in my code while creating the scoreboard. 
In addition, there were bugs that would not allow players to switch turns and get questions wrong.
I will continue to address these bugs in the upcoming versions of this game.

#inspiration
I was inspired to create this version of jeopardy from watching the television show and drawing from experiences reading my favorite books growing up.
